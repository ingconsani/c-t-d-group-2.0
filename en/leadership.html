                <h2>The journey I make available to you</h2>
                <p>I spent the last 18 months studying and programming in every free minute from my work as a Senior Executive Advisor for Bip, the largest Italian professional services company, to create a working prototype of Connect the DOTS. I felt the need to experiment, firsthand, with what you read and hear about AI. I started using Gemini 2.5 from its debut, and now I use the Ultra version in parallel on 2 machines and simultaneously on 4 windows to produce and test SW and content. I must say, I still find it hard to believe what I have already managed to do, exponentially increasing not only my productivity but also the things I learned to do that previously required the collaboration of dozens of people.</p>

                <h2>The experience I am ready to share</h2>
                <p>I started as a programmer and then learned to sell in what was the IBM sales university, where I also invented and launched third-party collaboration programs internationally and helped develop the first applications for SMEs in Italy. I have served some of the largest manufacturing clients in the world, as well as all the most important telcos and the largest European financial institutions. I have been responsible for large software delivery and system integration projects. I was an entrepreneur, together with a colleague and friend, of a small but prestigious consulting firm where I certified in most of the major sales methodologies. I have coached CEOs and executives all over the world and have always leveraged my creativity to develop the business of the blue-chip companies I worked for, managing to launch 7 successful startups in my career. In recent years, I have specialized in the world of consulting on CRM platforms, and lately, I have become an expert in AI and everything AI can do to help people live better and longer lives—experiences that led me to set out on my own again to launch Connect the DOTS.</p>
